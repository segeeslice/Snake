# TODO

### 1.4 release
- Neural back propogation / learning

### Other prospective improvements
- Snake redesign (connected going forward, open on sides)
- Persistent high scores
- Options menu
    - High score reset
    - Colors / themes *(?)*
    - Toggle switch between "normal" and "AI modes"
        - Normal mode would act as it does now
        - AI mode would have variable speed
    - Key rebinding?

### Investigative matters
- Further AI improvements
