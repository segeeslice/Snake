# Snake v0.3.0

A simple snake project I'm making for fun to learn the [Processing framework](https://processing.org/). Works as a functional replica of the classic snake arcade game (minus the scores...)

Introduced to Processing through and strongly inspired by the videos from [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q/).
