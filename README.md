# Snake v1.2.0

A simple project I'm making for fun to learn the [Processing framework](https://processing.org/). Works as a functional replica of the classic snake arcade game. Using this as a tool to learn and practice basic AI principles. You can demo this yourself via the "AI" difficulty (selected in the top left).

Introduced to Processing through and strongly inspired by the videos from [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q/).

See CHANGELOG.md in the base directory for post-release version updates.
