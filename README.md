# Snake v0.4.0

A simple project I'm making for fun to learn the [Processing framework](https://processing.org/). Works as a functional replica of the classic snake arcade game. Hoping to eventually implement something like a genetic algorithm for an AI to learn how to play.

Introduced to Processing through and strongly inspired by the videos from [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q/).

#### How to use (general)
- Download repo and locate the application.* folders in the base directory
