# Snake v0.1.0

A simple snake project I'm making for fun to learn the [Processing framework](https://processing.org/). Currently just a proof of concept more or less. Next step is to get it working as a functional game. May also delve into AI learning later through this project.

Introduced to Processing through and strongly inspired by the videos from [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q/).
